TODO:

Lower leg:
    make weight reduction cuts
    move mount to the bottom of leg (maybe can be moved more)
    make it longer properly
    add servo horn/clamp mount holes
    
Upper leg:
    see clearance between upper leg and lower leg
    design and add weight reduction and ease of access holes
    add ball bearing mounting holes
    center the servo on the legg, so it has symmetry
    
Shoulder:
    redesign to use 4 in tubing
    add the servo horn/clamp mount holes
    make sure the clearance between the leg and hip is good

Hip:
    make this piece
    just an elongated upper leg
    also, needs to mount to spine
    
Spine:
    add these parts
    this connects the two hips together
    add the needed mounting holes
